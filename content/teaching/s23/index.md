This course, "Advanced Course on using Mplus", is a five-day summer school course hosted by Utrecht Universityâ€™s department of Methodology and Statistics in Utrecht, the Netherlands. It consists of in-depth lectures on the fundamentals of SEM, Mplus, and advanced longitudinal models such as various cross-lagged panel models, growth curve models, longitudinal models with categorical latent variables, and dynamic structural equation models. 

**My Responsibilities**
I teach and organize multiple days in this course. The topics I teach about include: 

- Latent growth curve modeling,
- Latent class analysis and latent growth mixture modeling, and 
- Causal inference in cross-lagged panel research.
