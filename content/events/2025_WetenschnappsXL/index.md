summary: An panel discussion on how researchers can find the right experts for studying (the impact of) science communication efforts?.
abstract: 'Ivo van Vulpen (physicist and professor Science Communication in Physics at Leiden University and University of Amsterdam/Nikehef) and Nicos Starreveld (mathematician at University of Amsterdam and head of communications and outreach at Platform Wiskunde Nederland) share a question: Help! How do I connect with the right people to help me evaluate the impact of my science communication? If you are a scientist who loves to do science communication (SciCom), you want to do it well. This means you want to know what works, and that’s something you can research! But what if your own discipline limits you in performing the right evaluation of your SciCom efforts? You then face the challenge of lacking connections in the branches of science where such expertise resides.

Together with Marc van Mil (biomedical scientist and educational innovator at Utrecht University) and Jeroen Mulder who have experience with this interdisciplinary work, we’ll collectively try to provide answers to this question. How do you find complementary expertise, and how do you relate to them to make it a mutually beneficial project?'
