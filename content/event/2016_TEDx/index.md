summary: 'A personal TED-talk about disclosing your sexual identity. I gave this talk when I was a student in Communication Sciences at the University of Twente.'

abstract: '"Coming out of the closet" is the term we use when we talk about disclosing your sexual identity, a metaphor that has gained a greatly negative connotation over the years. Based on his personal experience, Jeroen makes a case for using the metaphor of an inspiring journey, focusing on the joys and upside of disclosing your sexual orientation, instead of on the downside of the claustrophobic closet.'
