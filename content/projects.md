I regularly consult researchers on their research projects, and help them with questions such as "Is this the correct method for answering my research question?", "What sample size do I need?", and "How do I adjust this method to fit my research project?". Such consultations are typically varied, and can cover the early phases of a research project (before data is collected, for example, when writing a grant proposal), the data analysis phase, as well as the writing up of the results. I greatly enjoy helping other researchers to improve their applied research projects. 

If you are interested in statistical consultation, please do not hesitate to [contact me](mailto:jeroendmulder@duck.com). We will first discuss if, and how I can help, and then take it from there.
