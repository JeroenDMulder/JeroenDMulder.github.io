I regularly consult researchers on their research projects, and enjoy this a lot. Such consultations are typically varied, and can cover the early phases of a research project (before data is collected, for example, when writing a grant proposal), the data analysis phase, as well as the writing up of the results. 

If you are interested in statistical consultation, please do not hesitate to [contact me](mailto:jeroendmulder@duck.com). We will first discuss if, and how I can help, and then take it from there.
