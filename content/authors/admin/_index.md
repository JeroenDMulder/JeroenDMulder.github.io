## Welkom, Welcome, Wilkommen

Hi there! My name is Jeroen, and I am a statistical researcher specialized in longitudinal data analysis methods for causal inference. In my research, I evaluate, compare, and develop analysis methods that are used in a variety of disciplines, ranging from psychology and social sciences, to epidemiology and biostatistics. I currently work as a postdoctoral researcher at Utrecht University (the Netherlands) and as a lecturer at Humboldt-Universität (Berlin, Germany).
