      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi there! My name is Jeroen, and I am a statistical researcher specialized in longitudinal data analysis methods for causal inference. In my research, I evaluate, compare, and develop analysis methods that are used in a variety of disciplines, ranging from psychology and social sciences, to epidemiology and biostatistics. I currently work as a postdoctoral researcher at Utrecht University (the Netherlands) and as a lecturer at Humboldt-Universität (Berlin, Germany).
