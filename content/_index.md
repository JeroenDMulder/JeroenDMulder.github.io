        Currently, my project concerns the use causal inference techniques (e.g., g-methods, debiased machine learning techniques) for the analysis of longitudinal, observational data in psychological research. 

        I find it important to always keep the end-users of the statistical methods (i.e., applied researchers) in mind. Therefore, I devote considerable time to the readability and comprehensibility of my academic articles; develop user-friendly applications for others to apply analytical techniques; and enjoy presenting about it at conferences and during lectures for bachelor and master students, doctoral candidates, and postdoctoral researchers.
